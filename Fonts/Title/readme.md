# TITLE DIRECTORY: Seeking Your Assistance in Adding Fonts

> You may ask, why is this folder so empty?

Well, it seems we haven't been able to locate any paid title fonts yet. However, we would greatly appreciate your help in expanding our collection! You can contribute by forking this repository and adding the title fonts you come across.

The process is quite straightforward. Follow these simple steps to contribute a new font:

1. Fork the repository to create your own copy.
2. Create a new folder with the font name, ensuring that the first word is capitalized.
3. Inside the font folder, include two files: `regular.woff` and `bold.woff`.
4. Once you have added the font files, commit your changes.
5. Open a pull request to request that your changes be merged into the main repository.

By following these steps, you can easily contribute and help us expand our collection of title fonts. We greatly appreciate your efforts in improving this resource for everyone to benefit from.

Thank you in advance for your contributions and happy font hunting!
